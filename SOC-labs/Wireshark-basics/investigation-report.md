# Wireshark Traffic Investigation  
**Lab: Wireshark Basics – Day 3 (Practical + Documentation)**

---

## Overview
This investigation documents hands-on network traffic analysis performed using Wireshark. The objective of this lab was to capture live network traffic, identify a TCP three-way handshake, analyze DNS query behavior, and document the findings in a structured SOC-style report. This project demonstrates practical packet analysis skills relevant to entry-level SOC and security analyst roles.

## Lab Environment
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux  
- **Tool Used:** Wireshark  
- **Network Interface:** eth0 (active interface)  
- **Capture Type:** Live packet capture  
- **Traffic Generation:** Manual web browsing activity  

---

## Methodology

### Traffic Capture
Wireshark was launched with administrative privileges to allow packet capture. The active Wi-Fi interface was selected based on visible traffic activity in the interface list. A live capture session was initiated, and network traffic was generated by visiting public websites using a web browser. After sufficient packets were collected, the capture was stopped for analysis.

This approach ensured the capture contained:
- DNS name resolution traffic
- TCP session establishment traffic

## TCP Three-Way Handshake Analysis

### Identification Process
To isolate TCP traffic, the following display filter was applied:

## TCP


Packets were analyzed by reviewing source IP addresses, destination IP addresses, and port numbers to ensure they belonged to the same session. The Transmission Control Protocol section of each packet was expanded to inspect TCP flags.

### Observed Handshake Sequence
A complete TCP three-way handshake was identified consisting of the following packets:

1. **SYN** – The client initiates the connection request to the server  
2. **SYN-ACK** – The server acknowledges the request and agrees to establish the connection  
3. **ACK** – The client acknowledges the server response, completing the handshake  

### Significance
The TCP three-way handshake confirms successful and reliable session establishment. In a SOC environment, abnormal or incomplete handshakes may indicate reconnaissance activity, denial-of-service attempts, or network misconfigurations. Understanding this behavior is critical for detecting suspicious traffic patterns.

## DNS Query Analysis

### Identification Process
To analyze DNS traffic, the following display filter was applied:

## DNS


DNS packets were inspected by expanding the Domain Name System section in the packet details pane.

### Observed DNS Activity
- **Query Type:** A (IPv4 address request)  
- **Query Name:** Domain requested by the client  
- **Response:** IPv4 address returned by the DNS server  

The DNS query was observed before the TCP connection, confirming standard network behavior where domain name resolution occurs prior to communication.

### Significance
DNS analysis is essential in SOC operations for identifying suspicious domains, command-and-control communication, and DNS tunneling activity. Establishing a baseline understanding of normal DNS behavior helps analysts quickly identify anomalies during investigations.

## Findings Summary
- Successfully captured live network traffic using Wireshark  
- Identified a valid TCP three-way handshake through TCP flag analysis  
- Observed DNS name resolution preceding TCP communication  
- Confirmed normal network behavior during web browsing activity

## Conclusion
This investigation provided hands-on experience with packet capture and protocol analysis using Wireshark. By identifying TCP handshakes and DNS queries, this lab reinforced fundamental networking concepts essential for threat detection and incident response in a SOC environment. These skills form the foundation for analyzing malicious traffic, indicators of compromise, and advanced network attacks.
